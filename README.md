- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @alicenormanid, a.k.a Alice.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently a Computer Science undergraduate student, nearly finished with my BSc! I am also the proud owner of a degree minor in the Biological Sciences.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in new and emerging technologies, cyber security, and computer networking. Aside from the tech-y stuff, I love to explore the outdoors via skiis, rollerblades, and mountain bikes. I am also an avid reader and self-directed learner with a passion for philosophy, cooking, and gardening (and coding, but you already knew that). âœ¨
